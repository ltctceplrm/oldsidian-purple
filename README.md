# Oldsidian Purple
A dark theme for obsidian based on the old pre 1.0 theme.
- Previous look of the callouts
- Previous checkboxes
- Red color for unspecified code
- Prettier purple highlights
- Previous look of the tags
- YAML back to regular font and size

Some additions:
- Minimum tab size of 100px (modifiable with --tab-min-width)
